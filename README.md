# vanilla-extract-rollup-example

This is an example for

- a component library using Vanilla Extract (and its [Rollup Plugin](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/#rollup)
- two example apps consuming the component library (Vite and Next.js)

## Setup

    yarn

## Run

    yarn dev

This uses turborepo to first build the UI packages and then launch the two example apps.
