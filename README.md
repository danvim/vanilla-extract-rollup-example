# vanilla-extract-rollup-example

This is an example for

- a component library using Vanilla Extract (built using the [Rollup Plugin](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/#rollup))
- two example apps consuming the component library (Vite and Next.js)

## Setup

    yarn

## Run

    yarn dev

This uses Turborepo to first build the UI package and then launch the two example apps.

You can also run build / dev commands in their respective directories manually without using Turborepo.
